        Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when

        We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force

        Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use
        Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and
        professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
        and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared
        belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to
        something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

        Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported
        in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in
        their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music
        salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques
        and best practices.

        If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and
        paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free German or English lessons.
        Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health
        insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and
        paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s not all work; we
        have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a
        variety of fun, informal small-group activities.
